# Drones
When I was in 10th grade, I led a team of high school students into building
drones with Arduino. The drones were rather unstable due to us beeing 10th grade,
yet they did fly.

Looking back, I wish I knew what watchdog was and how to implement it. This project
was financed by the "Stiintescu" local foundation. We had projects while I was in 10th
and 11th grade. Both projects revolved around building drones, either with Arduino or 
with flight controllers.

P.S. you can find more links and media on my linkedin.
